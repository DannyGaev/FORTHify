# FORTHify

## _Going FORTH with secure communications_
#
FORTHify is an implementation of the stack-based FORTH language designed for the encryption, decryption, and hashing of user communications. The main focuses of the project are:
1. To facilitate various encryption methods and their accompanying decryption methods
2. Provide hashing algorithms which consistently produce reliable hashes of inputs
3. To devote a particular emphasis on the speed at which these operations and algorithms take place

## Basic FORTH operations

In addition to secure communications, FORTHify supports many basic FORTH operations:

- 'DUP': Duplicate the top item on the stack
- 'DROP': Remove the top item from the stack
- 'SWAP': Swap the top two items on the stack
- 'OVER': Duplicate the second item on the stack
- 'ROT': Rotate the top three items on the stack
- '+': Addition
- '-': Subtraction
- '*': Multiplication
- '/': Division
- '=': Test for equality
- '<': Less than.
- '>': Greater than.
- '<=': Less than or equal to.
- '>=': Greater than or equal to.
- FORTHify is expected to support an even more extensive amount of operations soon!
